CLIPcherry Technology Stack

CLIPcherry is built on a modern, edge-first architecture that leverages cloud-based serverless services and blockchain technology. This stack ensures global performance, high scalability, and secure crypto transactions without the need for traditional servers.
Cloudflare Workers (Edge Runtime)

The platform's backend logic runs on Cloudflare Workers, a serverless JavaScript/TypeScript runtime deployed across Cloudflare’s global edge network. This means application code executes at data centers around the world, bringing the service closer to users for low-latency responses. Cloudflare Workers automatically scale to meet demand and require no explicit server management. All core functions—such as serving content, processing purchases, and authenticating users—are handled within these edge functions. The development and deployment of the Workers are managed using Cloudflare’s Wrangler CLI, enabling continuous deployment and version control of backend code.
Data Storage (Cloudflare D1 and KV)

Persistent data for CLIPcherry is stored using Cloudflare’s managed databases:
Cloudflare D1: A distributed SQL database (based on SQLite) used to store structured application data. D1 holds information like user profiles, creator content metadata, purchase transactions, and access permissions. Because D1 is cloud-hosted and integrated at the edge, queries can be executed quickly and without a separate database server.
Cloudflare KV: A key-value storage used for caching and configuration. The KV store provides ultra-fast read access at the edge, ideal for things like caching user session data, feature flags, or frequently accessed metadata. Using KV helps reduce database queries and speeds up response times by serving certain data directly from memory at regional Cloudflare nodes.
Both D1 and KV are fully serverless and replicated globally, ensuring data durability and quick access from anywhere.
Media Services (Images and Video)

Handling user-generated media is a critical part of CLIPcherry’s stack:
Cloudflare Images: All creator-uploaded images (including photos or thumbnails) are stored and delivered via Cloudflare’s Images service. When a creator uploads an image, the platform uses the Cloudflare Images API to securely store it, returning a unique image ID (for example, the CLIPcherry logo is stored this way). Cloudflare Images automatically handles image optimization, resizing, and global CDN delivery. This ensures that supporters loading an image (like a photo for sale) get a fast-loading, properly scaled version from a server nearest to them.
Cloudflare Stream: Video content is managed through Cloudflare Stream. Creators’ videos are uploaded to Stream via API, where they are encoded and stored. Stream provides adaptive bitrate streaming, so supporters can watch purchased videos smoothly on any device and connection quality. The videos are delivered securely and efficiently through Cloudflare’s network without the creators or platform needing to manage video servers or bandwidth.
Using these media services offloads heavy image and video handling to Cloudflare’s infrastructure. Notably, CLIPcherry implements image blurring for previews — for example, a creator’s images are automatically blurred (e.g., an 8 px radius blur) until a purchase is made. This is achieved either by storing a blurred preview variant or by applying a blur filter in the front-end, ensuring that full-quality content is only visible to paying supporters.
Blockchain Integration (Crypto Payments)

A defining feature of CLIPcherry is its use of cryptocurrency for transactions. The platform integrates with blockchain networks to accept and distribute payments:
XRP Ledger: CLIPcherry uses XRP for fast, low-fee transactions. An XRP secret (private key) is configured as a Worker secret, allowing the backend to sign transactions or manage an XRP wallet. Creators might receive payouts in XRP directly to their wallets, and supporters can pay in XRP to purchase content. The choice of XRP provides quick settlement and minimal transaction cost.
Bitcoin (BTC): The platform also supports Bitcoin payments. A Bitcoin extended public key (XPUB) is stored (via Wrangler secret) to derive unique Bitcoin addresses for purchases. When a supporter chooses to pay in BTC, the system generates a new address from the XPUB for that transaction. This allows CLIPcherry to track incoming payments per purchase without holding private keys on the server. The Worker monitors the blockchain (via third-party APIs or scheduled checks) for the transaction to be confirmed.
Payment Processing: When a supporter initiates a purchase, the backend provides them with payment instructions (e.g. a unique crypto address or QR code). It then listens for the blockchain payment confirmation. Once the payment is detected and verified on-chain, the Worker updates the database to unlock the content for that supporter. This flow removes the need for credit card processors, using trustless blockchain validation instead.
By leveraging crypto networks, CLIPcherry enables borderless transactions—supporters anywhere can purchase content with crypto, and creators receive funds without intermediary delays. All crypto secrets and keys are stored securely via Cloudflare’s environment secrets (never exposed in code or version control).
Front-End Application

The front-end of CLIPcherry is a responsive web application that communicates with the Cloudflare Worker backend. It is likely built with modern JavaScript and packaged as static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) in the /public directory, which are deployed alongside the Worker or via Cloudflare Pages:
User Interface: The UI follows the design guidelines outlined in the Graphics Standards Manual, ensuring a consistent look and feel (fonts, colors, spacing, etc.). It supports both light and dark themes as defined by the style guide. The layout is responsive, adapting to desktop and mobile screens with a mobile-first approach.
Client-Side Logic: The front-end handles rendering content feeds, purchase buttons, and applies effects like image blur for locked content. Before a purchase, images are displayed in a blurred state (per the design rules). After a successful crypto payment, the application either fetches the unblurred high-resolution image from Cloudflare Images or removes the blur overlay, thus granting the supporter access.
API Communication: All interactions (like logging in, browsing content, making purchases, etc.) go through the Cloudflare Worker’s API endpoints. Because these endpoints run at the edge, users experience very fast responses. The front-end likely uses fetch/XHR calls to RESTful endpoints or GraphQL (depending on implementation) provided by the Worker.
By separating the front-end as a static client and the back-end as an edge API, CLIPcherry achieves an efficient single-page application experience. The architecture allows quick navigation and dynamic content updates without full page reloads, while still enforcing security (uncached API responses, auth checks) via the Worker.
Security and Performance

The chosen technology stack inherently provides a high level of security and performance:
Security: Cloudflare’s platform offers built-in DDoS protection and SSL encryption by default. All communication between users and CLIPcherry is over HTTPS. Sensitive secrets (like crypto keys) are kept in Cloudflare’s secure storage and never directly exposed. The use of serverless functions means there is no traditional server to be compromised, and Cloudflare regularly patches and secures the runtime environment. Additionally, content access control is enforced both in the front-end (visual blurring/hiding) and back-end (authorization checks before serving unblurred content or video streams).
Performance: Being edge-first means user requests are handled by a data center geographically close to them, reducing latency. Static assets (images, video, and the front-end files) are cached on Cloudflare’s CDN nodes. Dynamic requests are executed on Workers which have very short cold-start times and can handle many requests in parallel. The system scales horizontally by design—Cloudflare will run as many instances of the Worker as needed across its network. This allows CLIPcherry to serve a growing global audience without performance degradation or manual scaling.
In summary, the technology stack of CLIPcherry combines modern web and blockchain tools to create a platform that is globally accessible, fast, and secure by default. Each component—from edge computing to media delivery to crypto payments—plays a role in delivering a seamless experience for creators and supporters.
