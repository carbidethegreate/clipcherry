# CLIPcherry Platform Technical Architecture

## Overview

CLIPcherry is built as a **fully serverless, edge-first platform** on Cloudflare’s global network. Instead of a traditional centralized server, the application’s logic and data are distributed across Cloudflare’s services worldwide. This architecture delivers low-latency access to users everywhere and scales automatically to meet demand. Key components of the stack include Cloudflare Workers for backend logic, Cloudflare D1 for relational data, KV for caching, Cloudflare Images/Stream for media storage, and direct blockchain integration for payments. By leveraging these managed services, CLIPcherry can securely handle content delivery and crypto transactions without maintaining any servers or proprietary tokens. The sections below detail each Cloudflare component’s role, the end-to-end data flows (from user registration and age verification to content purchase), security considerations, and how the system achieves global performance and scalability.

## Cloudflare Components and Their Roles

* **Cloudflare Workers (Edge Compute)** – The core backend of CLIPcherry runs on **Cloudflare Workers**, which are serverless functions deployed to Cloudflare’s edge network. Workers handle all API requests, routing, and business logic: user authentication, serving content metadata, processing purchases, etc. Because Workers run in every Cloudflare data center, user requests are served by a nearby location, minimizing latency. The platform doesn’t manage any servers or regions – Cloudflare automatically scales the Workers across thousands of nodes, providing exceptional performance and reliability. The Workers are written in JavaScript/TypeScript and deployed via Cloudflare’s Wrangler CLI. They are stateless per request (any persistent state is kept in D1/DO/KV), which allows Cloudflare to route requests flexibly and scale to zero when idle.

* **Cloudflare D1 (Serverless Database)** – CLIPcherry uses **D1** as its primary database for structured data. D1 is Cloudflare’s managed SQL database built on SQLite and Durable Objects. It stores all persistent information: user accounts, creator profiles, content listings (titles, descriptions, prices, and references to media), purchase records (who bought what and when), age verification flags, etc. Each D1 database is accessible from Workers with SQL queries. Because D1 is built on Cloudflare’s network, queries execute close to the Workers, and data is replicated for global availability (with strong consistency for writes ensured via Durable Objects). This means CLIPcherry can perform transactional updates (e.g. adding a purchase record) with immediate consistency and have fast reads across the world due to D1’s read replicas. Schema migrations are managed via SQL files in the repository (`/schema` directory), ensuring the database structure can evolve. In summary, D1 provides the relational backbone of the platform (for example, an SQL query fetches all content a creator has uploaded, or checks if a user has already purchased a video).

* **Cloudflare Workers KV (Key-Value Store)** – The platform uses **Workers KV** as a distributed caching layer and quick-access store for certain data. KV is an eventually-consistent, globally replicated key-value store. CLIPcherry uses it to cache ephemeral or high-read data, such as session tokens, user preferences, or frequently accessed lists. For instance, when a user logs in, the Worker might store a session identifier mapping to the user ID in KV, so that subsequent requests can be authenticated by reading the KV (which is extremely fast at the edge, often <10ms). Similarly, a cached list of “trending creators” or site config flags could be stored in KV to avoid frequent database hits. KV’s eventual consistency (updates propagate within seconds) is acceptable for these use cases. The benefit is that data in KV is available at Cloudflare’s edge nodes globally, so read requests are served from memory close to the user. By using KV for session and config data, CLIPcherry achieves low-latency responses and reduces load on D1.

* **Cloudflare Images (Image Storage & CDN)** – All creator-uploaded photos and image files are stored and delivered via **Cloudflare Images**. Instead of handling image uploads on our own server, the platform uses Cloudflare’s direct upload feature: the Worker requests a one-time upload URL from Cloudflare Images (with `requireSignedURLs=true` for privacy) and returns it to the creator’s browser. The creator’s browser then uploads the image file **directly to Cloudflare** using this URL (bypassing our backend). Cloudflare Images stores the file and returns an image ID. That ID is saved in D1 as part of the content record. Because we set `requireSignedURLs`, the image is private by default (it can only be accessed with a valid signed token). For content previews, the platform can use Cloudflare Images to generate **variants** (e.g., a thumbnail or a blurred version). For example, a small blurred thumbnail URL could be constructed for browsing, without exposing the original. When a supporter purchases an image, the Worker will generate a short-lived signed URL token allowing the full-resolution image to be fetched. All image delivery (thumbnails or originals) is then handled by Cloudflare’s CDN, meaning images load quickly from a local edge cache. Offloading images to Cloudflare Images provides built-in resizing, optimization, and global delivery, so CLIPcherry’s users get fast and optimized images without custom infrastructure.

* **Cloudflare Stream (Video Storage & Streaming)** – Creator-uploaded videos are managed through **Cloudflare Stream**. The workflow is similar to images: the Worker uses Stream’s API to get a direct upload URL for the creator, who uploads the video file directly to Cloudflare’s servers. Cloudflare Stream then handles transcoding the video into various resolutions and formats for adaptive streaming. A unique video UID is returned and stored in D1 with the content record. Videos on Cloudflare Stream can be marked to require signed URLs (making them private). CLIPcherry sets this so that videos can’t be viewed just by knowing the ID. When a supporter wants to watch a purchased video, the Worker generates a secure playback token via Stream’s API or using a signing key. This token (JWT) is time-limited and tied to the video ID (and possibly the user). The front-end either embeds the Cloudflare Stream player with this token or uses a Stream embed link that includes the token, allowing the video to play. Cloudflare Stream delivers the video using HLS/DASH over its CDN, ensuring smooth playback with adaptive bitrate. Like images, the heavy lifting (storage, encoding, global distribution) is offloaded to Cloudflare. The Worker’s role is to coordinate uploads and issue access tokens. This integration means CLIPcherry doesn’t need its own video servers or processing pipeline – it benefits from Cloudflare’s optimized video platform.

* **Cloudflare R2 (Object Storage)** – For certain binary data that doesn’t fit Cloudflare Images/Stream, CLIPcherry uses **R2**, Cloudflare’s S3-compatible object storage. A key use-case is storing the **government ID images** uploaded for age verification. These are sensitive user uploads that we want to keep secure and private. Instead of storing raw ID scans in D1 (which is for structured data) or Images (which is more for public image serving), the Worker stores them in an R2 bucket. Before storage, the Worker **encrypts** the ID image with a strong key (for example, using AES-256) managed as a secret in Cloudflare Workers. The encrypted blob is then put into R2, and only a reference (like an R2 object key or ID) is saved in D1. This way, even if someone accessed the bucket, the IDs are unreadable without the key. R2 is ideal here because it can store large files cheaply and with automatic durability, and it has **no egress fees**, so the Worker can retrieve the object when needed without cost. The ID images are not accessed frequently – only during verification or if an admin reviews them – so R2’s slightly higher access latency is acceptable. We also store a downsized, watermarked version of the ID (or just the user’s photo and DOB) for the user’s profile, possibly using Cloudflare Images for that small thumbnail. By using R2 for raw sensitive media, we ensure the main database isn’t bloated with blobs and we keep tight control over access (only through our Worker, with encryption). This approach follows security best practices and Cloudflare’s reference architectures (using R2 for user-generated files and D1 for metadata).

* **Cloudflare Durable Objects (Stateful Coordination)** – **Durable Objects (DO)** are employed to manage state and coordination where strong consistency is required. Each Durable Object is a single-instance JavaScript class that Cloudflare will route requests to, ensuring ordered, synchronous processing. In CLIPcherry, we use Durable Objects for scenarios like **payment processing coordination** and possibly real-time interactions. For example, when a supporter initiates a purchase, a Durable Object instance (perhaps one per purchase or per user) can be used to track that purchase’s state – waiting for payment, confirming, then marking it paid – without race conditions. Because only one instance of a given DO ID exists globally, it can act as a lock or sequencer. This prevents, say, two simultaneous events from crediting the same purchase twice or any out-of-order updates. Durable Objects also provide their own storage, which is **strongly consistent and transactional** for that object. We leverage this by storing small bits of state (like an order’s status) directly in the DO when needed, and/or by using DOs to make atomic updates to D1. Another use is **session management** – a DO per active user could maintain WebSocket connections or handle updates to the user’s context in real-time. While our Workers are mostly stateless, DOs let us introduce stateful logic where necessary (e.g., a chat room or a live stream coordination in the future). Cloudflare routes each DO to a specific region (usually near where it’s first needed or configured), and ensures all related requests go to that instance, which guarantees consistency. In summary, Durable Objects are our solution for any workflow that needs a single authoritative process (payment finalization, concurrency control, etc.) within this distributed system.

* **Cloudflare Workers AI (Edge AI Inference)** – To facilitate **automated age verification**, CLIPcherry integrates **Workers AI**, which is Cloudflare’s serverless GPU-powered AI inference platform. When a user uploads an ID image for age verification, the Worker can call a Cloudflare AI inference endpoint to run an **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** model on the image and extract the birth date text. Cloudflare’s Workers AI supports running popular models (including image and text analysis models) directly on Cloudflare’s edge GPUs. For example, a computer vision model (like a specialized OCR or even a general model like Microsoft’s ResNet or open-source OCR libraries) can be invoked with just a few lines of code, and it will execute on Cloudflare’s network near the data. This means we don’t have to send the ID image to an external API – the extraction is done within Cloudflare, preserving privacy. The OCR result (the date of birth string) is returned to our Worker. We then parse it and verify the age. This entire process is nearly instant and fully automated: as soon as the user uploads their ID, the system checks if their age (today’s date minus DOB) meets the 18+ requirement. Workers AI provides a secure, scalable way to run these AI tasks on demand, and it’s pay-as-you-go, so we only incur cost when using it. If needed, we could also use an external OCR service or library, but Workers AI is a convenient in-platform solution that keeps data within our infrastructure. (Note: Cloudflare’s platform also supports running WASM libraries, so another approach could be to use a WASM-compiled Tesseract OCR in the Worker itself if AI was not available. However, Workers AI with proper models is more efficient for this use case.)

* **Cryptocurrency Payment Integration (XRP & BTC)** – CLIPcherry accepts **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **XRP** for content purchases, eliminating the need for any platform-specific token. The payment handling is designed to be trust-minimized and secure. When a supporter initiates a purchase, the Worker presents a unique crypto address for payment and then monitors the blockchain for the transaction. For **XRP**, the platform uses a single XRP account with unique **destination tags** for each order (or each user). The Worker, having an XRP secret key stored as a secret binding, can generate or use a destination tag and instruct the user to send the exact amount of XRP to the platform’s address with that tag. Because the XRP Ledger has near-instant confirmation (a few seconds), the Worker can either poll an XRP API or, better, use a webhook from an XRP monitoring service to know when the payment arrives. For **Bitcoin**, CLIPcherry uses an extended public key (**XPUB**) stored in the Worker’s secrets (the corresponding private key is **not** in the system, only the xpub). Using the xpub, the Worker can deterministically generate a fresh deposit address for each purchase (typically via a BIP-44 path increment). This means every supporter gets a unique BTC address to pay into, and we don’t reuse addresses – improving privacy and making tracking easier. The Worker records this address in D1 along with the expected amount. Then, it listens for the payment: since Bitcoin can take minutes to confirm, the Worker might use Cloudflare’s Cron Triggers or an external service’s webhook to periodically check if the address received the payment. Once the required confirmations are met, the Worker marks the transaction as complete. All crypto keys and secrets are kept in Cloudflare’s secure storage (inaccessible to the public or GitHub). Importantly, the platform **never exposes private keys** – for BTC we use only public keys in code, and for XRP the private key is used only to potentially sign transactions for creator payouts (never revealed to users). CLIPcherry’s crypto integration thus relies on direct blockchain interactions: a user sees a payment QR code or address, sends crypto, and the system automatically verifies it on-chain. This approach avoids traditional payment processors and their fees. After confirmation, the purchased content is unlocked for the user. (In practice, to improve user experience, we likely use a combination of client-side polling and server-side events to update the purchase status as soon as the payment is detected.)

All these components work in unison to provide a seamless experience. Cloudflare Workers act as the orchestrator, tying together the database (D1), cache (KV), storage (Images/Stream/R2), and external blockchain networks. Next, we walk through how these pieces come together in typical user flows.

## End-to-End Data Flow: Registration, Content Upload, and Purchase

To illustrate how the system works, consider the full journey from a new user signing up (with age verification) to a creator uploading content, and finally a supporter purchasing that content. The diagram below (conceptually) shows the interactions between the user’s browser (client) and Cloudflare’s components at each step. *Each number corresponds to a step described in detail.*

*(Diagram: A flowchart of the CLIPcherry architecture. Users (supporters/creators) interact via the browser; arrows go to Cloudflare’s edge (Workers), which then calls out to Cloudflare Images, Stream, D1, KV, etc., and external blockchain APIs. Steps 1–6 below correspond to registration, upload, browsing, purchase, confirmation, and content delivery.)*

1. **User Registration & Automated Age Verification:** A new user (supporter) visits CLIPcherry and signs up for an account. During registration, because the platform deals with adult content, the user is required to verify their age. The registration form includes fields for the usual information (username, email, password) and prompts the user to upload a picture of their government ID. When the user submits this form:

   * The browser sends the data and ID image to the Cloudflare Worker (over HTTPS). The Worker creates a new user entry in D1 (storing hashed password, email, etc., initially marking the user as unverified for age).
   * The raw ID image file is processed for age verification. The Worker calls **Workers AI** to run an OCR model on the ID photo and extract the birth date. The model scans the text on the ID (like date of birth field) and returns a result, e.g., “1990-05-14”. The Worker receives this text and parses it to a date.
   * The Worker compares the birth date to the current date to calculate the user’s age. If the user is under 18, the registration is rejected (the Worker returns an error and does not activate the account). If the user is adult, the Worker marks the D1 user record as `age_verified=true` and logs the verification date.
   * The ID image is **encrypted and stored** for compliance record-keeping. Before storage, the Worker generates an encryption key (from a secret or using the user’s own password as part of a key derivation) to encrypt the image bytes. The encrypted image file is then saved in Cloudflare R2 under a secure path (for example, `ids/<userId>.enc`). A reference to this file (and perhaps the used encryption scheme or a hash) is saved in D1. The original image uploaded by the user is not stored in plain form anywhere.
   * To allow the user to see that their ID was uploaded (without exposing sensitive info), the Worker might generate a **blurred thumbnail** of the ID or extract just the portrait photo from it. This tiny thumbnail (heavily blurred or watermarked “Verified”) can be stored in Cloudflare Images or R2 and linked to the user’s profile. It serves as a visual confirmation for the user that they are verified, but it’s not clear enough to be sensitive. Only the user (when logged in) can view their own ID thumbnail, via an authenticated Worker request.
   * Finally, the Worker creates a session (e.g., a JWT token or a session ID stored in KV) so the user stays logged in. At this point, the user account is fully registered and age-verified without any manual admin intervention. The entire process, from upload to verification, happens within a few seconds, leveraging OCR to automate what would otherwise require a human check. CLIPcherry now meets compliance for age gating by having a DOB on file and proof of verification for this user.

2. **Creator Content Upload:** A user with a creator account can upload new content (photos or videos to sell). The process for uploading content ensures large files bypass our core Worker (to improve performance) and that the metadata is recorded transactionally:

   * The creator opens an “Upload Content” page in their browser and fills in details: title, description, price (in USD or in crypto terms), and selects the media file (either an image or a video). When they click “Upload/Submit,” the browser first makes an API call to the Worker (e.g., `POST /api/content/init-upload`) to initialize the upload.
   * The Worker, upon receiving this, generates **direct upload URLs** for the media files:

     * If it’s an image, the Worker calls Cloudflare Images **Direct Creator Upload** API to get a one-time upload URL and image ID. It sets `requireSignedURLs=true` for this image so that it will be private. The API returns an `uploadURL` (an endpoint on `upload.imagedelivery.net` specific to our account) and an `id` (which is the asset’s identifier in Cloudflare Images).
     * If it’s a video, the Worker calls Cloudflare Stream API (either a specific “direct upload URL” endpoint or creates a new Stream video object). Cloudflare Stream might return a direct upload link or credentials to upload to a certain URL (e.g., a tus protocol endpoint or a form upload endpoint at Cloudflare). We ensure the video is marked private (no public playback without a token).
     * The Worker returns these upload URLs (and any needed auth tokens for the upload endpoints) to the creator’s browser.
   * The creator’s browser now directly **uploads the file to Cloudflare**. This means the file data (which could be large, e.g., a 500MB video) goes straight to Cloudflare’s storage edge, not through our Worker (saving us from handling that bandwidth). The browser will show progress, and Cloudflare’s endpoint will handle receiving the bytes. Once the upload is complete:

     * For images: Cloudflare Images stores it and we can consider it done (the image is immediately available via its ID for transformation).
     * For videos: Cloudflare Stream begins encoding the video. This might take some time depending on length/size. Stream can send a webhook or at least we can query its status. In the meantime, the video is in “processing” state.
   * The creator’s browser then notifies our application that the upload is done (perhaps the initial API call was waiting/polling, or it makes another `POST /api/content/finish` call). Alternatively, the initial `init-upload` call could have created the DB record in a “draft” state and the final step is just confirming it.
   * The Worker finalizes the content record in D1: it inserts a new row in a `Content` table with the creator’s user ID, title, description, price, type (image/video), and the Cloudflare Images ID or Stream video UID. It also sets flags like `isPublished=true` and `videoStatus="processing"` if applicable.
   * The Worker responds to the creator that the content has been successfully created. The creator’s dashboard now can show the new item (with perhaps a “processing” label if it’s a video not ready yet). Cloudflare Stream will notify (via webhook or the creator refreshing) when the video encoding is done, at which point the content becomes available for purchase.
   * **Preview Generation:** As a final step, the platform generates a preview that supporters will see. For images, the preview might be a heavily blurred version or a low-res thumbnail. We can generate this by using Cloudflare Images variants (e.g., an 100px thumbnail with blur) and store that variant URL in the database. For videos, a thumbnail or a short GIF of a few frames can be used as the preview. Cloudflare Stream often provides a thumbnail (the first frame or a random frame) accessible via API. We fetch that and associate it with the content record (or on-the-fly use an endpoint that returns it).
   * The heavy operations of storing and encoding media are all handled by Cloudflare’s infrastructure, so the creator gets a smooth experience. They don’t have to wait for a long upload to a distant server – Cloudflare likely has an upload node near them – and our own system isn’t stressed by the file size. The result is an entry in our database that points to a piece of content ready (or soon to be ready) to sell.

3. **Browsing Content & Viewing Previews:** Now that content exists, supporters can discover and preview it. When any user browses the site (e.g., viewing a creator’s profile or the marketplace of content):

   * The front-end requests a list of content (could be a static rendered page or an API call like `GET /api/content?creator=<id>` or `GET /api/feed`). The Cloudflare Worker handles this by querying D1 for the relevant content records – for example, “SELECT \* FROM Content WHERE creator = X AND published=true”.
   * The Worker returns the metadata for each item: title, price, type (image/video), and references to the media. Importantly, to show a preview, the Worker provides a URL for the preview image:

     * For images, as mentioned, we might have a variant ID for a blurred thumbnail. If so, the Worker can compute a **signed URL** for that variant using Cloudflare Images (if the variant is set to require signed URLs). Alternatively, if the variant is not sensitive (blurred), we could have left that variant public. In that case, the Worker can just give the public URL for the variant (which is on the `imagedelivery.net` domain). Usually, since we set requireSignedURLs true globally, even variants might require a token, so likely the Worker uses its API key to fetch or generate a token for the blurred version. Another approach: the Worker could return the original image ID plus a directive that the front-end should apply a blur via CSS. But that risks someone fetching the original via the ID, so it’s safer to only give out an already-blurred asset.
     * For videos, the Worker can provide the thumbnail image URL. Cloudflare Stream’s API might allow an unauthenticated thumbnail fetch (since a single frame doesn’t reveal the whole video content). If not, we could store the thumbnail in Cloudflare Images (when the creator uploads, perhaps we also upload a snapshot as an image). Assuming we have a URL for it, the Worker includes that. For example, a thumbnail might be available at `https://videodelivery.net/<videoUID>/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg` (if accessible), or we have an Images ID for it.
   * The front-end displays the list: blurred images and video thumbnails, with titles and prices. Users who haven’t purchased see everything locked/blurred. If a logged-in supporter has already purchased an item, the front-end (knowing from the user’s account data or an API call that they own content X) can fetch the unblurred version. Typically, the Worker could expose an endpoint like `GET /api/content/<id>/access` that checks if the user has access and then returns a one-time URL for the raw image or video.
   * When a supporter clicks on a content they haven’t bought, they might see a content detail page with a larger preview (still blurred) and a purchase button. The system ensures that no high-res content is delivered until purchase: even if someone tried to inspect network calls, they would only see the blurred or watermarked assets.

4. **Purchase Initiation (Crypto Payment Workflow):** Suppose a supporter decides to buy access to a particular content item. They click “Unlock for \[price]”. The following sequence happens to handle the cryptocurrency transaction:

   * The front-end calls the Worker (e.g. `POST /api/purchase`) with the content ID and the chosen payment currency (BTC or XRP). The request includes the user’s authentication (session token or cookie, so the Worker knows who is buying).
   * The Worker first **validates** the request: checks that the user is logged in, age-verified, and that the content is still available for purchase (e.g., not already bought by them, and the creator is active, etc.). It then looks up the price of the content from D1. Prices could be stored in USD or a fixed crypto amount; assume it’s stored as an amount in USD or a stable value and the system will convert to crypto equivalent. If needed, the Worker could fetch a real-time conversion rate (from an API or a cached feed) to know how much BTC or XRP equals that price at the moment.
   * Next, the Worker **creates an order record** in the database (D1). This includes: user ID, content ID, chosen currency, amount (in that currency), a generated unique payment address or tag, and a status (e.g., “pending”). Let’s call this record a Purchase or Order table entry, and it has a primary key (order\_id).
   * The Worker then **generates payment instructions**:

     * **For XRP:** It uses the platform’s XRP account address (say `rPlatformAddress`) and obtains either a new destination tag or a unique memo ID for this transaction. The XRP ledger allows attaching a 32-bit destination tag to identify the recipient user or order. We could, for simplicity, use the order\_id as the destination tag if it fits (and ensure it’s unique and within range). The Worker prepares a message: “Send X XRP to address `rPlatformAddress` with Destination Tag `12345`.” If the platform uses multiple XRP accounts or a third-party service, it could also request a fresh deposit address for each order, but using tags on one address is simpler.
     * **For BTC:** The Worker derives a new Bitcoin address from the stored XPUB. Using a library or built-in capability, it takes the next index (perhaps the order\_id or a sequential counter) and derives the address (bech32 or similar). This address is unique to this order. It saves the derivation index in the order record so it knows which one was given. The Worker then prepares instructions: “Send Y BTC to address `1ABC...XYZ`.” It might also provide a QR code data (which the front-end can render as an actual QR for easy scanning).
   * The Worker returns a response to the front-end containing the payment details: which cryptocurrency address, amount, and any additional info (destination tag, etc.). It may also include a timeout (“Please pay within 30 minutes”) if we plan to expire orders.
   * The front-end displays these instructions to the user along with perhaps a **countdown or waiting UI**. At this point, the user will send the payment using their crypto wallet. They might scan the QR code in their wallet app and confirm the transaction on the blockchain.

5. **Payment Confirmation and Order Fulfillment:** Once the supporter sends the crypto, the system needs to detect it and unlock the content. This is how that happens:

   * **XRP confirmation:** The XRP Ledger typically confirms transactions in \~4-5 seconds. We could integrate a webhook from an XRP monitoring service (or run our own lightweight XRP node or use a public API). For example, there are services where you can register a callback URL for a specific address+tag combination. We have the platform’s address and we know the tag, so a service could call our Worker at `POST /webhook/xrp` with details when a payment with that tag arrives. Alternatively, the Worker could use Cloudflare **Cron Triggers** to run every minute and call an XRP Ledger API (like `api.xrpldata.com`) to check the latest transactions for our account. Given the speed, a webhook is preferable for near-instant response.

     * When the Worker gets a notification (webhook) or finds the transaction via polling, it will verify the details: Does the destination tag match an order in pending status? Does the amount >= expected price? Is the transaction confirmed (finalized) on the ledger? If all good, it updates the corresponding order record in D1 to `status='paid'`, records the transaction hash, and the timestamp.
     * It also might credit the creator’s earnings balance. For instance, the content price minus platform fee is added to the creator’s account balance in D1. (Transferring the payout to the creator’s crypto wallet might be a separate process triggered later, or manual.)
   * **BTC confirmation:** Bitcoin transactions take longer. We likely will require at least 1 confirmation (which can be \~10 minutes) for unlocking content. The Worker can’t just sit and wait that long in a single request, so we handle it asynchronously. One approach: use **Cloudflare Queues** or a Durable Object to track pending BTC orders. For example, when the order was created, we enqueue a job “monitor order\_id X for BTC payment”. A separate Worker (or a scheduled Worker) processes that queue by querying a blockchain API. Another approach: use a service like BlockCypher, Blockstream, etc., that can send a webhook when a certain address receives funds.

     * Let’s say we use a polling approach with Cron: every X minutes, a background Worker wakes up and checks all pending BTC orders that haven’t expired. It calls a blockchain explorer API for each address or uses a batch API if available. If it finds the transaction (with the required confirmations), it triggers the same update: mark order as paid, log tx hash, credit user’s access, etc. For better efficiency, we might integrate a webhook service to avoid constant polling.
     * As a safety measure, the platform might show the user the purchase in a pending state (“Awaiting 1 confirmation...”) and only unlock after confirmation. In the unlikely case of a double-spend or cancellation, not unlocking immediately prevents giving content without payment.
   * **Unlocking access:** Once an order is marked paid in the database, the Worker (perhaps the same one handling the webhook or a separate process) will create an **access record**. This could be an entry in a join table like UserContentAccess(user\_id, content\_id, purchase\_id). This record means user X is entitled to view content Y. We may also update a cache (e.g., put a key in KV like `access:<user_id>:<content_id> = true` for quick checks).
   * The Worker may also notify the user’s session. If the user is still sitting on the page waiting, the front-end could be polling an endpoint `/api/purchase/status?order=<id>`. The Worker can respond to that with “paid” once done. Or better, we could use a WebSocket or SSE (Server-Sent Events) to push a message. Cloudflare doesn’t directly support server push from Workers without a client connected (unless using Durable Objects with WebSockets), but a simple approach is short-interval polling on the client.
   * When the front-end sees the payment is confirmed, it will update the UI (“Payment received! Unlocking your content…”). The user can now access the content.

6. **Content Access Delivery:** After a successful purchase, the supporter can view or download the content. Ensuring only authorized users can do so is crucial:

   * If the user now tries to view an **image** they bought, the front-end will request the unblurred image. This might be done by reloading the content detail via an API call, where the Worker now sees that user has access and returns a **signed URL** for the original image. Concretely, the client could call `/api/content/1234/view` – the Worker checks `UserContentAccess` for that user and content. If found, it uses Cloudflare Images API to create a **temporary token** (JWT) that allows access to the original image ID. It sends back a URL like `https://imagedelivery.net/<account>/<image_id>/public?token=...`. The front-end can either redirect the browser to this URL or directly set the img src to it. The image will then load in full quality. The token might be set to expire in, say, 5 minutes. (If the user is still viewing after that, the browser likely cached it already. If not, they could fetch a new token.)
   * If the user accesses a **video**, the front-end will embed the Cloudflare Stream player. For a private video, we again need a token. The Worker can either generate a **signed playback token** (as a JWT) for the specific video, or use a pre-generated embed link that includes the token. Cloudflare Stream’s player might accept a token parameter. Another method: we set the video to allow our domain (referer) so that any embed on clipcherry.com is valid. But token is more secure. The Worker provides the front-end with an embed code or a URL that contains the token (as shown in Cloudflare’s docs, it’s often the video URL replaced by the token string). The front-end places this in an `<iframe>` or video element. The Stream player then fetches the video segments. As long as the token is valid, the content plays.
   * The user now can watch the video or see the image clearly. In the UI, the blur overlay is removed and maybe a watermark with their username or order ID could be applied to discourage sharing (optional enhancement: Cloudflare Images supports adding text overlay on the fly, or we could have pre-watermarked the content).
   * If the user tries to access content they haven’t bought, the Worker will not grant a signed URL. Even if they somehow find out an image ID or video UID, Cloudflare’s requirement for signed URLs means the request would be denied without a token. This ensures content security.
   * Meanwhile, the purchase record could trigger other events: for example, the system could send a notification to the creator: “Your content was purchased by @username!” or increment a sales counter in D1. These could be done asynchronously via Durable Objects or Queues (to batch notifications).
   * The platform may also log an analytics event (perhaps in another system or just in D1) for metrics – e.g., content popularity, revenue tracking, etc.
   * **Subsequent Access:** Once purchased, a user typically has indefinite access to that content (unless the platform has time-limited access by design, but that wasn’t stated). So, on future visits, if the user navigates to that content, the front-end knows they own it (by checking a cached list or calling an endpoint). It will then immediately fetch the content using the same mechanism (requesting a new signed URL). The workflow is invisible at that point; it feels like just viewing any owned item on a cloud service.

Throughout this flow, because everything is edge-hosted, the interactions are quick. Database queries and writes (D1) are done in the same data center as the Worker handling the request, and media is delivered from Cloudflare caches. Even payment status checks can be edge-accelerated (the Worker is near the user, while blockchain checks are external but those responses aren’t user-facing until confirmed).

## Security and Compliance Considerations

Operating a platform like CLIPcherry involves handling sensitive content and personal data (including IDs and crypto transactions). The architecture incorporates multiple layers of security and compliance measures:

* **Secure Data Transmission:** All client-server communication happens over HTTPS with Cloudflare’s TLS. This includes form submissions (like ID uploads) and content delivery. Cloudflare automatically provides SSL and can enforce HSTS, etc., meaning data in transit is encrypted.

* **Personal Data & Privacy:** We store user personal data (emails, profile info) in D1, which is encrypted at rest by Cloudflare. Passwords are hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) before storage – only the hash is in the DB. Sensitive fields can be encrypted at the application level too if needed. We also utilize Cloudflare’s **Secrets** for any credentials (API keys, crypto secrets, encryption keys) so that they never appear in code or logs. Workers only access them in memory when needed.

* **Government ID Handling:** This is one of the most sensitive parts. Our approach:

  * The ID images are **encrypted client-side or immediately upon receipt**. Ideally, we could have done client-side encryption (the user encrypts the image with our public key before upload), but since we run OCR on it, we have to see it server-side. Therefore, we do server-side encryption as soon as possible after OCR. We use a strong symmetric key (which could be unique per user or a master key) stored in Cloudflare Secrets. The original image is never written to disk or storage unencrypted – it’s either in memory during OCR and then the cipher text is stored in R2.
  * Access to ID data: Only the user’s own account (to see a verification badge or thumbnail) and perhaps a very limited admin function can retrieve these from R2 (and only in encrypted form unless an admin tool decrypts with a secure key). We could implement an automatic deletion: for instance, one month after verification, delete the ID image (keeping just a record of verification). This reduces long-term risk. Regulatory compliance might require keeping it for a certain period, though.
  * **Compliance with Age Verification Laws:** By extracting and storing the date of birth (and potentially an ID type/number as proof), we comply with various laws requiring age checks for adult content (e.g., in certain jurisdictions). We also respect privacy: only the needed info (DOB) is used, and we explicitly obtain user consent to use their ID for age verification. Our privacy policy would detail this.
  * Since the process is automated by AI, no human staff sees the user’s ID, which is good for privacy. But the accuracy is high – modern ID OCR can parse dates from standard IDs very reliably. If the OCR fails (e.g., low quality image), we could fall back to manual review or ask the user to retry with a clearer photo.

* **Content Security:** Protecting creators’ paid content is crucial (it’s their livelihood):

  * **Access Control:** We implemented signed URL requirements for both images and videos. This means even if someone knows an asset’s ID, they cannot retrieve it without a valid token that only the Worker can generate for authorized users. Tokens are short-lived to prevent sharing. Cloudflare’s enforcement of signed URLs on Images and Stream provides a robust gate at the CDN level.
  * **Previews and Watermarks:** By only showing blurred or low-res previews, we ensure that non-paying users can’t obtain high-quality content. Even the blurred previews are delivered such that they cannot be used to reconstruct the original (they’re significantly degraded). We may also employ visible or invisible watermarks on content delivered (for example, overlay the buyer’s username lightly on video frames) to discourage users from leaking it. Cloudflare Stream doesn’t natively watermark, but we could do something like serve videos via a Worker that adds a watermark on the fly (more complex) or ensure images have an exif tag or subtle mark. This is an optional layer.
  * **Anti-scraping and Bots:** We can use Cloudflare’s **Bot Management** and **WAF** to prevent automated scraping of content. For example, if an IP tries to fetch a large number of image thumbnails or attempts to brute force tokens, Cloudflare WAF rules can block it. We will likely deploy a rule that challenges or blocks non-browser user agents that hit content endpoints aggressively. Additionally, **Turnstile** (Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA alternative) can be used on the signup or purchase page if we suspect bot activity.
  * **DDoS and Abuse Mitigation:** Since our entire application is behind Cloudflare, we benefit from their DDoS mitigation network which has massive capacity. The Worker can also enforce rate limiting at the application level (e.g., a user cannot attempt more than X purchases per minute or cannot call the content API more than Y times per second) – but many of these things Cloudflare can handle with their built-in tools (Firewall rules, etc.). By using Cloudflare’s network, typical DDoS attacks (like flooding the site with requests) would be absorbed and filtered out by Cloudflare’s edge long before it would impact our logic.
  * **Web App Security:** Cloudflare WAF can protect against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) by inspecting requests. Furthermore, our use of prepared statements or ORMs with D1 and not interpolating user input directly helps prevent SQL injection. Workers run in a sandbox, and we don’t execute arbitrary code from users. We also avoid storing any sensitive data client-side beyond tokens (and those are HttpOnly if cookies, or handled safely).

* **Cryptocurrency Security:**

  * We do not custody user funds beyond the purchase transactions (and possibly creator earnings temporarily). The crypto payments are push-only: the user sends crypto to us. This means we’re not handling things like storing users’ private keys or similar – a huge reduction in risk. The platform’s own crypto keys (our XRP account secret, our BTC xpub and maybe an offline xprv for moving funds) are held securely. The XRP secret in the Worker is used to potentially send XRP out (like paying creators). We ensure this secret is only accessible by privileged code paths. If the platform accrues a lot of XRP, we might periodically move it to cold storage (manually or via a scheduled Worker trigger).
  * The XPUB is not sensitive by itself (cannot spend funds, only generate addresses). The actual Bitcoin received goes to addresses derived from that xpub, whose private keys correspond to an offline master seed. That means even if the Worker was compromised, the attacker cannot steal the BTC because they’d only get the xpub. However, they could see incoming transactions. We mitigate this by treating the xpub as secret too (not exposing it) just to avoid leaking financial info.
  * We rely on blockchain confirmations, which ensures that we only unlock content when a payment is final. For XRP, finality is typically within seconds with negligible risk of rollback. For BTC, one confirmation is usually enough for modest amounts (or we could wait for 2-3 if higher assurance needed). This avoids fraud like chargebacks, which often plague credit card systems. There’s no concept of chargeback in crypto; once confirmed, it’s done.
  * We have to consider exchange rate volatility: if content is priced in USD but paid in BTC, large delays could matter. However, given content likely has relatively low prices and confirmations in \~10 min, it’s not a big issue. We could also price content in stable terms or frequently update the BTC required. This is more of a business detail than security, but worth noting.

* **Compliance (KYC/AML, etc.):** While CLIPcherry’s content creators and buyers are pseudonymous (only email needed, perhaps), the platform still has the ID verification for age (KYC-lite) on supporters. We should handle that data per privacy laws:

  * **GDPR:** If applicable, users can request their data to be deleted. We have built our system such that we can erase a user’s personal data: in D1 we’d delete their account (or anonymize), and remove their ID image from R2. The content they purchased might remain (the creator still has it up for sale), but records linking the deleted user to it can be scrubbed (or replaced with an “deleted user” ID). Because we don't store real names or addresses (just email and username, and an ID image which we’d delete), compliance is feasible.
  * **Content Moderation:** The architecture hasn’t explicitly covered it, but presumably any illegal content or policy-violating content needs to be handled. Cloudflare provides **Stream moderation** options and perhaps we could integrate AI to scan uploads. This might be a future consideration: e.g., when a creator uploads an image, we could use an AI model to detect certain banned content (like minors, extreme violence, etc.). Workers AI or third-party APIs could assist. Cloudflare also has an “Images Moderation” service via partners but not sure. At the very least, a DMCA or takedown process is in place, and because our files are on Cloudflare, we can remove them swiftly by deleting from Images/Stream and our DB.
  * **Crypto regulatory compliance:** Since transactions are crypto-only and involve no fiat, CLIPcherry likely isn’t a money transmitter. Creators receiving funds might have to handle their own taxes. If the platform takes a cut, that’s revenue to us, which we handle in accounting. We should keep logs of transactions (which we do in D1: order records with tx hashes serve as an audit trail). If any law enforcement asks, we can point to the public blockchain transactions.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Cloudflare Workers provides logs for console output and exceptions, which we can integrate with a logging service via Workers Logpush. We will log important security-related events: login attempts, payment failures, etc. in a secure manner (no sensitive data in logs). Cloudflare’s network also gives us analytics: e.g., how many requests, performance timings, etc., accessible through their dashboard or APIs. For blockchain monitoring, we might set up alerts if large amounts are received or if any suspicious activity (like many small payments from one user) happens – though this is more of an anti-fraud consideration.

In summary, the architecture is **security-by-design**: data is distributed and access-controlled, and by using Cloudflare’s platform, we inherit robust protections (DDoS mitigation, WAF, isolation of code, secure default configurations). The sensitive aspects (IDs, crypto secrets) are handled with encryption and minimal exposure. Compliance requirements (age checks, data protection) are addressed through automation and careful data handling. We have minimized the “trust surface” – for instance, we don’t have to trust a third party with ID verification data since we do it in-house with AI, and we don’t have to trust a payment gateway since transactions are on-chain. All of these choices reduce the avenues for data leaks or breaches, while maintaining a smooth user experience.

## Global Scalability and Performance

One of the biggest advantages of building on Cloudflare is effortless global scalability. CLIPcherry’s architecture is inherently designed to serve a worldwide user base with high performance:

* **Edge Network Deployment:** The application logic (Workers) runs on Cloudflare’s edge network of 300+ cities. This means when a user in Europe or Asia makes a request, it’s handled by a server nearby, not sent across the world to a single origin. The result is sub-100ms latency for most API calls because the distance is short. Likewise, the static assets (images, videos, and even the HTML/JS of the site) are served via Cloudflare’s CDN, which caches content at those same global locations. Users get fast page loads and media streaming no matter where they are. We effectively sidestep the speed-of-light latency issues of centralized servers by always executing and delivering from an optimal location.

* **Automatic Scaling (Serverless):** Cloudflare Workers scale horizontally without any intervention. If our platform suddenly gets a spike of traffic (say a particular video goes viral and thousands of people try to purchase it at once), Cloudflare will simply instantiate more Worker isolates across its network to handle the load. There’s no concept of “running out of server capacity” – we are only limited by Cloudflare’s very high limits (which are in the millions of requests per second across the network). Similarly, Cloudflare Stream and Images are built to handle massive volumes (they back many large customers). We don’t have to pre-provision bandwidth or servers; Cloudflare’s infrastructure handles it. This also means **cost efficiency**: we pay only for what we use, and we don’t maintain idle servers for peak capacity. During quiet periods, there are effectively zero resources in use (and near-zero cost).

* **Low Latency Data Access:** Data stored in Cloudflare’s systems (D1, KV) is accessible with low latency from Workers. D1 will eventually support full multi-region replication; currently, reads are fast and writes have the strong consistency via Durable Objects. Cloudflare KV is already designed for high-read scenarios with global caching – it is optimized so that hot keys are served from memory at the edge. For example, if thousands of users check the status of a popular creator’s profile (which might involve reading a KV key for “creator profile views” or something), those reads hit the edge cache and respond in a few milliseconds. KV writes propagate in the background, but since we’re mostly using it for caching, it’s fine. We also make use of HTTP caching where appropriate: certain API responses that are the same for everyone (like a list of top content) could be served with a short-lived CDN cache so that repeated requests in a region don’t even invoke the Worker every time.

* **Durable Objects Placement:** Cloudflare’s system will place each Durable Object in an optimal location, and it can migrate them if needed. For instance, if we have a DO for an ongoing live chat room (just as an example of future feature) and most participants are in Asia, Cloudflare may instantiate that DO in an Asian data center. This way, messages broadcast have minimal latency for that audience. In CLIPcherry’s current usage, DOs like a purchase tracker might reside near our core D1 location (to quickly commit transactions). Cloudflare ensures routing is efficient so that contacting a DO from a far edge is still pretty fast (they manage a global lookup for where the DO lives).

* **Media Delivery Optimization:** Cloudflare Stream delivers video using adaptive bitrate streaming and has nodes worldwide that cache video segments. If a video becomes popular, its segments will be cached at many edges, meaning only the first viewer in a region might experience the slightly slower fetch, and subsequent viewers get it from cache. Cloudflare Images similarly caches image variants at edges once requested. Cloudflare’s image resizing can also serve different device resolutions from the edge, saving bandwidth for mobile users and further speeding up load times. All this ensures that even bandwidth-heavy content is served efficiently and scales to many concurrent viewers.

* **Front-end Performance:** The front-end is a single-page app that likely uses modern frameworks. We host the static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) on Cloudflare Pages or directly via Workers Sites. These assets are cached on the CDN. So the initial load of the site is extremely fast. After that, navigation is mostly API calls for data, which (as described) are very low latency. We also benefit from Cloudflare’s HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support for quicker transfers. Additionally, because our compute is at edge, there’s reduced time-to-first-byte for dynamic content.

* **Scalability of Blockchain Interactions:** A potential bottleneck could be querying blockchain data (which happens outside Cloudflare’s network). We mitigate this by leveraging efficient APIs and only querying as needed. For XRP, it’s so fast that handling even hundreds of payments per minute is feasible with a single connection or webhook stream. For BTC, if we ever needed to monitor many addresses, we might use an external service that indexes addresses (like Blockstream Esplora or an API that supports batch queries). This part scales by delegating to blockchain infrastructure providers. We also isolate these calls so that if one is slow, it doesn’t block the whole system (e.g., a payment lookup might be done asynchronously).

* **Testing and Deployment:** Because the stack is serverless, deploying new code is one command (`wrangler deploy`) which propagates to the edge in seconds. We can run staging environments easily (Wrangler supports environments that could deploy to a separate domain and D1 database for testing). This agility means we can scale development and iteration as well – pushing updates without downtime. Cloudflare’s infrastructure handles versioning, so we can even do traffic splits if needed (for A/B testing new features globally in a controlled way).

* **High Availability:** There is no single point of failure. If a Cloudflare data center goes down, traffic is automatically routed to the next nearest. If an entire region has an outage, others pick up the slack. Our data is durably stored (D1 writes to Durable Objects which have storage on SSDs and are backed up by Cloudflare; R2 and Images/Stream replicate data). Cloudflare itself has multiple layers of redundancy and a history of very high uptime. In short, an outage would require Cloudflare itself to be having a widespread issue, which is rare and swiftly mitigated by them. Even then, static content might still serve from cache for a while to users. So CLIPcherry should be highly available worldwide at all times.

* **Future Growth:** This architecture can accommodate growth in features as well. If we add a real-time chat or live streaming, Cloudflare has capabilities (Durable Objects can act as chat servers, Cloudflare Live Stream for live video, etc.). If we onboard significantly more creators and supporters, the underlying services (D1, R2, etc.) scale with usage (we might need to upgrade our plans or optimize queries, but not a fundamental re-architecture). We can also make heavy use of Workers Cron triggers for scheduled tasks (e.g., payout processing every day, cleaning up expired orders, etc.) which run at edge too. All this without managing any traditional servers or regions.

In conclusion, CLIPcherry’s technical architecture is **globally distributed by default** and can seamlessly handle a growing user base. By using Cloudflare’s edge network and serverless stack, every user gets fast access, and the system transparently scales to meet demand. We’ve focused on leveraging Cloudflare’s strengths (edge computing, CDN, and integrated services) to ensure that performance remains high as we grow. A user in New York and a user in Sydney will have a similarly snappy experience. Creators can reach a global audience without worrying about content delivery or latency. This global-first approach, combined with the security measures described, positions CLIPcherry as a modern, efficient, and resilient platform for premium content delivery.

**Sources:** The design is informed by Cloudflare’s official documentation and reference architectures for building full-stack applications on its platform. These sources confirm the capabilities of Cloudflare services (like Workers, D1, KV, Images, Stream, R2, and Workers AI) and best practices for building a scalable, secure application with cryptocurrency integration. The age verification approach is supported by OCR technology references, ensuring compliance with legal requirements while maintaining user privacy. Overall, this architecture leverages cutting-edge serverless technology to meet the project’s goals.
